What is Sonarqube?
==================

	Sonarqube is a static code analyzer.

	static means it is not going to change or go anywhere.

* There is client-server architecture.

* Sonarqube is a server, which is constant & live. As many clients will come & go but
  server will be always available.

* Code analyzer ==> It is going to check the code in your project for:

	1) Whether the code is following best practices of your programming language:
	   In Java:
	   ========

		- The variable names, method & class names must follow best practices.

		- The exception block should not contain parent class Exception

		  try {
			...
		  }catch(Exception e) { // not best practice
			...
		  }

		- The exception block should not be empty.

		  try {
			...
		  }catch(Exception e) {  }

	 2) Code smells:
	    ============
		Just like an expert cook can easily find whether cooked item is cooked
properly or not from its smell, an expert developer can easily find out problem in code
by just looking at it.


* Bloaters
	- Long Parameter List (around 35 to 40 parameters is a bad method) 

	- Primitive Obsession ==> Taking primitive data types even when objects are
				  suitable.

	- Long Method/Large Class (Method is containing too much of code. Cognizant's
	  own standard is 80 lines per method).

* Object-Orientation Abusers

	- Calculating salary of all kind of employees in a single class. There should be
	  sub classes & their salary should be calculated there.

* Change Preventers

	- Writing code that will require lot of changes e.g. database url, username, password are hardcoded.

* Cyclomatic complexity:
  ======================

Cyclomatic complexity = E - N + 2*P 
where,
  E = number of edges in the flow graph.
  N = number of nodes in the flow graph.
  P = number of nodes that have exit points

	This is a major that indicates complexity of developed code.

	Appropriate no. <= 4.

	More complex code is difficult to debug.

* Code coverage:
  ==============

Whether entire developed code is tested or not. To what percent code testing is covered?

* Downloading & running sonarqube:
  ================================

	- https://www.sonarqube.org/downloads/

	- Requires jdk 11

	- Put 
wrapper.java.command=C:/Program Files/Java/jdk-11.0.7/bin/java

 	  in wrapper.conf in conf folder of installation.

	- Go to windows-x86-64 folder below bin folder below installation folder of 
          sonarqube.

	- double click StartSonar.bat

	- Open browser and type 'localhost:9000' (default port 9000).

	- Download my maven based project which is at: 
       https://github.com/GeniusJavaTrainer/CapgRepository/blob/master/sonarqubedemo.zip

	- Unzip & import it as Maven project in Eclipse.

	- Right click on it - Run as - Run configurations

	- In Goal type 'clean install sonar:sonar'

	- Go to the hyper link suggested by end of building project successfully.
